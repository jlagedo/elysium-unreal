# Seam Migration

> Working note, not owned documentation. It carries no task status — `docs/project/roadmap.md`

> It exists to get the migration clear in my own head before any of it is promoted.

## What this is

The project began by learning how to work with VtMB assets and Unreal at the same time. That took
many iterations and a lot of exploration, and it produced a running POC. But as with anything built
by exploring, the knowledge came at the cost of a messy trail: the way an asset gets from the VtMB
install into the running game is not one path, it is several, laid down one after another as each
exporter was written.

The scope of this note is to settle that one question — how assets are exported from the VtMB
install, and how they are deployed into the game runtime — and nothing else.

## Current shape

Four separate mechanisms carry content into the running game today.

**1. The loose export root.** `FElysiumContentPaths::Root()`
([ElysiumContentPaths.h:14](Source/ElysiumUE/Private/ElysiumContentPaths.h#L14)) resolves
`-ElysiumContentRoot=`, else `ELYSIUM_EXPORT_ROOT`, else `$ELYSIUM_WORK_ROOT/exports`. It is
game-derived and gitignored, and the runtime reads it directly, at runtime, as loose files:

- `shared/` — decoded textures (`tex/`, optional `tex_hi/`), static model OBJ/MTL (`props/`),
  `manifest.json`, `materials.json`
- `<map>/` — `.obj`, `_sky.obj`, `.spawn`, `.sky`, `.env`, `.lights`, `.props`, `.ents`, `.hulls`,
  `.dispcol`, `.decals`, `.ropes`, plus per-map `tex/cube/`
- `npc/` — `.eskm` containers, `npc_index.json`, and the JSON sidecars beside them
  (`clips/`, `facial/`, `procedural/`, `blends/`, `eyes/`, `garment/`)
- `items/` — `ground_models.json`, `wield/` and `wield_models.json`
- verbatim mirrors of the install's own text trees — `scripts/`, `dlg/`, `cfg/`, `vdata/`,
  `scenes/`, `lip/`, `expressions/`, `signs/`, `ui/`, and `sound/`

**2. The `/ElysiumBaked` plugin mount.** Real `.uasset` content baked offline by
[bake_map.py](pipeline/unreal/bake_map.py), [bake_characters.py](pipeline/unreal/bake_characters.py)
and [bake_wield.py](pipeline/unreal/bake_wield.py): the shared texture/material/mesh corpus, one
`.umap` per map, the cast (skeletons, meshes, clips, blend spaces, cloth), animated props, and the
wield corpus. Game-derived and gitignored — only the `.uplugin` descriptor is committed.

**3. `/Game/ElysiumGenerated`.** Packages the project generates for itself rather than decodes:
world materials, audio routing, UI fonts, input assets, the boot map, the dialogue camera set, the
player animation blueprint.

**4. `/Game/ElysiumAuthored`.** The one tracked, hand-authored package namespace — nothing
generated, nothing derived from the install.

Two smaller paths sit outside all four: `Content/Fonts`, tracked OFL faces read off disk at draw
time, and `Saved/Elysium/ScriptFS`, the writable overlay VtMB's own scripts write into.

On the export side there are likewise two families. The original `UE_extract_*.py` set writes the
loose export root above and is what the runtime reads today. The newer `*_glb.py` set is
**export_v2**: one GLB unit per source kind, specified by `docs/architecture/seam_map*.md`, writing
to `exports_v2` ([paths.py:41](pipeline/src/elysium_pipeline/paths.py#L41)). Nothing in the runtime
reads `exports_v2` yet.

## Legacy export ledger

What the non-v2 family writes and who actually reads it. *runtime* = game C++ reads it loose at
runtime (the set `Content/ElysiumCorpus` must carry until that slice migrates); *bake* = input to a
`.uasset` bake (never deploys); *none* = written today, read by nothing.

| Product (under export root) | Exporter | Consumed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<map>.obj`/`.mtl`, `<map>_sky.obj`, `brushes/*` | UE_bsp_to_scene | bake (`.obj` also runtime existence gate) |
| `<map>.ents`, `.lights`, `.env`, `.sky` | UE_bsp_to_scene | **both** |
| `<map>.hulls`, `.dispcol`, `.spawn`, `.ropes` | UE_bsp_to_scene | runtime |
| `<map>.props`, `.decals`, `.water`, `.materials.json`, `.weather.json`, `.particles.json`, `tex/cube/*` | UE_bsp_to_scene | bake |
| `<map>.sprites` | UE_bsp_to_scene | none |
| `shared/tex/*` (+ `tex_hi/`) | UE_extract_corpus | **both** (runtime: sky cube only) |
| `shared/props/*`, `manifest.json`, `materials.json` | UE_extract_corpus | bake |
| `items/ground_models.json` | UE_extract_items | runtime |
| `items/wield/**`, `wield_models.json` | UE_extract_wield | bake |
| `npc/*.eskm`, `banks/`, `placed_models/`, `npc_manifest.json`, `tex/`, `garment/` | UE_mdl_skeletal, npc_export, UE_mdl_cloth | bake |
| `npc/npc_index.json`, `blends/`, `eyes/` | npc_export | **both** |
| `npc/clips/`, `facial/`, `procedural/` | npc_export | runtime |
| `sound/**`, `audio/catalog.json` | UE_extract_sounds | runtime |

| `scripts/**`, `dlg/**` | UE_extract_scripts | runtime |
| `cfg/*` | UE_extract_cfg | runtime |
| `vdata/**` | UE_extract_vdata | runtime (also npc_export input) |
| `signs/*.txt` | UE_extract_signs | runtime |
| `signs/tex/*`, `backgrounds.json` | UE_extract_signs | none |
| `ui/strings.json`, `ui/art/**`, `ui/menu/title.png` + `sprites/`, `ui/effects/*` | UE_extract_ui | runtime |
| `ui/resource/`, `ui/menu/skybox/`, `ui/menu/particles/`, `ui/manifest.json` | UE_extract_ui | none |
| `particles/**` (raw mirror + `*.png`) | UE_extract_particles | bake |
| `hud/use_icons.png` + `.json` | UE_use_icons | runtime |

## Proposal

Converge on one path. export_v2 GLB is the standard every export moves to, and everything that is a
better fit as an Unreal asset lands as one — a mesh, texture, material or sound as its native type,
and structured data as a `UDataAsset`, decided case by case rather than as a blanket rule. The
target is a single, unified runtime workflow rather than four.

Done, in this order:

1. **Exporter convergence.** The `UE_extract_*` family is retired or rewritten onto the export_v2
   GLB seam, so there is one export contract.
2. **Runtime consolidation.** The game resolves every resource through a single mechanism, with any
   exception named explicitly here rather than left implicit.

Baking does not go away. export_v2 produces the inspectable intermediate; the bake still turns it
into the `.uasset` content the game loads.

## Settled

**Overlay policy for vdata readers (owner call, 2026-08-30).** Scripts write vdata through the
ScriptFS overlay in two cases: the haven PC rewrites `vdata/hackterminals/haven_pc.txt` (real
gameplay — emails), and the hunter-mode easter egg copies `" - hunter"`/`" - vampire"` variants over
base files (stats, strings, signs, items). Decision: **terminal definitions stay overlay-first**
([ElysiumTerminal.cpp](Source/ElysiumUE/Private/Substrate/ElysiumTerminal.cpp)) and must not
regress when vdata moves to `Content/ElysiumCorpus`; **rulebook tables and signs read
corpus-only** — the hunter-mode variant swap is a named deliberate divergence, unsupported.
Faithful support would need overlay-aware reads plus cache invalidation and cross-session overlay
semantics; if ever wanted, it is a scoped task with the terminal loader as the reference. Promote
the divergence note to the owning vdata topic when this migration lands.

**Units are source capsules (owner call, 2026-08-30).** The unit contract's `reject_opaque_source`
rule — units must not embed their source bytes — was never an owner decision and is repudiated. An
export_v2 unit is a self-contained capsule: it carries the exact winning source bytes of each
member (BIN chunk, hash-checked against `sourceResolution`) alongside the full decode. The decode
and byte-ledger validation remain mandatory — the capsule never excuses decoding. The corpus
import lane extracts bytes from the capsule, so import reads only `exports_v2`. Rollout: required
for `vtmb:vdata:` now (schema 1.1.0); every other seam adopts when its slice migrates.

**Install curation (2026-08-30).** The install was found with all nine hunter-swappable vdata
base files byte-equal to their `" - hunter"` twins — the easter egg had been triggered in this
install and VtMB's own script overwrote them in place. Restored from the `" - vampire"` twins
(owner-approved, one-time write to the otherwise read-only install); every export before this
date carried hunter data in `stats`, `strings`, `credits`, `traiteffects000`, four armor items
and `signs/death`.

**Slice 1 layout (committed).** Runtime resolves content through `Content/` (`ElysiumAuthored`,
`ElysiumGenerated`, `ElysiumCorpus` — deployed loose corpus, gitignored) and the `/ElysiumBaked`
plugin; the export trees are build/review areas with no runtime reads. Slice 1 moves vdata
(minus `signs/`, which stays on the legacy flat export until its own slice): `uv run elysium
import vdata` deploys capsule bytes to `Content/ElysiumCorpus/vdata/**`, `VdataDir()` and the
ScriptFS `vdata/` mount flip to it.

## Open questions

**Where do the props go?** A map's geometry, materials and textures already bake to `.uasset`, but
static-prop placement still travels as the `<map>.props` sidecar that
[bake_map.py](pipeline/unreal/bake_map.py) reads. In export_v2 the placements are already inside
the `vtmb:map:` unit as scene nodes (`seam_map_map.md`, "Static props"), so the question is on the
bake side, and there are two candidate answers:

- fold the placements into the baked `.umap` as actors, so opening the level is all it takes; or
- emit a companion `UDataAsset` the runtime spawns from, keeping placement inspectable and
  reloadable without a level rebake.

What would settle it: whether anything needs to change prop placement without rebaking the level
(a debug surface, a live tweak, a per-session variation), and whether folding them in breaks the
shared-vs-per-map split the corpus bake depends on. Needs a test, not an argument.

**What happens to the resources that cannot become Unreal assets?** VtMB's level scripts and
dialogue are loose `.py` and `.dlg` text imported into an embedded CPython VM at map load; `cfg/`
is Valve console syntax the console bridge seeds itself from; `vdata/` is the whole RPG rules layer
as KeyValues. Some of these plausibly become `UDataAsset`s, but each is its own call — a script the
VM imports by path is not the same problem as a rules table read once at startup. Undecided, and
deliberately so: this is the question the migration has to answer, one resource at a time.
